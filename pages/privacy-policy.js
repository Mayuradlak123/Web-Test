                <h2>Rights:</h2>

                <p>Users who provide information through our website, as data subjects and data owners, have the right to

                <h2> Is personal information about me secure?</h2>


                <p>Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized
                    access to your account and personal information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately
                    and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished
                    accessing your account.</p>


                <p> We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other personal information we hold in our
                    records, but we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software
                    failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>

                    practices on other sites. When following a link to another site you should read that site's privacy policy.

                <h2>Will WellnessZ share any of the personal information it receives?</h2>
                <p> We neither rent nor sell your personal information in personally identifiable form to anyone. We share
                    your personal information in personally identifiable form with third parties only as described below. In
                    terms of the Services, the Company shall share the information collected from You with only such
                    third parties in relation to whom you provide express consent.</p>


                <p>Affiliated businesses and third-party websites we do not control: In certain situations, businesses or
                    third-party websites we're affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the Platform
                    (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such
                    a transaction or service, and we will share your personal information with that affiliated business only
                    to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service.</p>


                <p> Agents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share
                    your information with them to provide the Services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do
                    not have any right to use the personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to
                    assist us.</p>



                <p>User submissions: Any content or personal information that you voluntarily disclose online in a
                    manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes
                    publicly available, and can be collected and used by others.</p>





                <p>  Business transfers: We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer
                    information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Also, if we (or substantially all of
                    our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, personal information would
                    be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.</p>


                <p>Protection of WellnessZ and others: We may release personal information when we believe in good
                    faith that release is necessary to comply with laws; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other
                    agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of WellnessZ, our employees, our users, or
                    others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud
                    protection and credit risk reduction.</p>


                <p>With your consent: Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your personal information may
                    be shared with third parties, and you will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.</p>


                <h2>Cookie Policy</h2>

                <p>We may collect information from you (or others on your behalf) de-identified information to help us in
                    our business and provide you with the relevant Services. Such anonymised and de-identified
                    information does not constitute personal information and may be transferred, disclosed, assigned,
                    leased, licensed, sold and otherwise shared with and by our partners, service providers, advertisers
                    and/or other third parties for purposes permitted under law.</p>

                    enable log-ins, provide interest-based advertising, analyze how our Services are performing) are an
                    example of such anonymised data which we collect. While compiling information about your browsing
                    habits, cookies can also enhance your user experience. There may also be third party cookies on our

                <p>Our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your browser or device, when you click on

                    service, a third party may also transmit cookies to you. For the avoidance of doubt, this Privacy Policy
                    does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we are not responsible for their privacy
                    policies and practices. Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track
                    your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honour ‘Do
                    Not Track’ requests that you have set using your browser or device.</p>


                <p>If you do not consent to our use of cookies, you should adjust your browser settings accordingly or
                    not use any of the Services.</p>

                <p>Your interest profile can be removed by deleting your browser’s cookies.
                    The cookie information stored on the User's hard drive is: (i) User segment hits or information on a
                    specific product, service, brand or model in which the User has shown interest during its visit to a
                    certain website and (ii) time and date stamp of the latest update of the User profile.</p>



                <p>If the cookie is deleted by the User, all profile data is removed. For the sake of clarity, no segments
                    relating to information which WellnessZ considers sensitive have been or will be created, such as
                    segments relating to political opinions, religious beliefs, physical or mental health conditions or sexual
                    life. Further, WellnessZ is very sensitive to the issue of children's privacy and marketing directed to
                    children. No segments are intended to be established for the profiling of children.</p>
